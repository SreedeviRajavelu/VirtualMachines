## Docker Macvlan Network 

A macvlan nerwork allows each Docker container to appear on the same Layer 2 network as your host (Ubuntu VM).

- Each container gets its **own unique IP address** on your **physical LAN** (e.g. 192.168.30.x)

- The containers can be reached directly by other devices on that LAN - without NAT.

Because of that, the macvlan network must be bound to your host's physical network interface (the one actually connected to your LAN or VM bridge).

```

From your ip a output:

2: enp0s3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP>

    inet 192.168.30.60/24

‚úÖ enp0s3 is UP, has a valid IPv4 (192.168.30.60/24), and is your main interface connected to the external network.

That makes enp0s3 the correct interface to use for a macvlan network.

The others:

lo ‚Äî loopback (ignore)

docker0 ‚Äî Docker‚Äôs internal bridge (not physical, so not usable for macvlan)

So yes, you should use enp0s3 for your macvlan setup.

There are three private IPv4 address ranges defined by RFC 1918.
These are reserved for internal networks only (they are not routable on the public Internet).

| Private Range                     | CIDR  | Typical Use                   |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------- |
| `10.0.0.0` ‚Äì `10.255.255.255`     | `/8`  | Large enterprise LANs         |
| `172.16.0.0` ‚Äì `172.31.255.255`   | `/12` | Corporate or internal subnets |
| `192.168.0.0` ‚Äì `192.168.255.255` | `/16` | Home, office, and VM networks |

Create Docker macvlan network

## Accessing docker macvlan network from host machine:



1. How Docker macvlan works

When you create a Docker network using the macvlan driver, Docker gives each container its own virtual MAC address and attaches it directly to the physical network via the VM‚Äôs NIC (e.g., enp0s3).

Each container looks like a separate device on the LAN ‚Äî it can communicate directly with:

Other containers on the same macvlan network

Other physical machines on the same LAN

But here‚Äôs the catch üëá

The host interface (the Ubuntu VM itself) is not automatically connected to this macvlan network.

This is by design ‚Äî Linux macvlan interfaces cannot talk to their parent interface (and vice versa).

So the VM‚Äôs main NIC (enp0s3) cannot directly send or receive packets to/from containers on the macvlan network.

## Question: 

How do I create and persist a linux virtual network interface on the ubuntu VM so that I can access the docker containers which I create on the docker macvlan network inside the ubuntu vm on the host, these are the details of how I created the docker macvlan network and the docker container on the ubuntu vm create docker macvlan network on ubuntu vm (which I have sshed into):

- `docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=192.168.30.0/24 --gateway=192.168.30.1 -o parent=enp0s3 plc-macvlan`

- create and run the docker container for plc in ubuntu vm : 

`docker run -d --name st_plc--net plc-macvlan --ip 192.168.30.201 --privileged openplc:v3`

I want to access this website on my host machine : http://192.168.30.201:8080/login

Perfect ‚Äî you‚Äôve explained this clearly, and your goal is exactly right üëè

You already have:

The Ubuntu VM running with IP 192.168.30.60 on interface enp0s3

A Docker macvlan network (plc-macvlan) attached to that interface

A PLC container with IP 192.168.30.201 on that macvlan

Now you want to access that container‚Äôs web UI (OpenPLC) from your host machine (e.g., your physical computer running VirtualBox, VMware, or similar).

Let‚Äôs go step-by-step and make the setup both functional and persistent.

üß† Why This Is Needed
As you already know:

A macvlan network gives containers their own MAC addresses and puts them directly on the LAN.

But the Ubuntu VM itself (the host of the containers) can‚Äôt communicate with them, because Linux doesn‚Äôt allow the parent interface (enp0s3) to talk to its macvlan children.

Step 1: Create the macvlan interface (temporary test)

Run these inside your Ubuntu VM (SSH session):

```
# Create the macvlan0 interface attached to enp0s3
sudo ip link add macvlan0 link enp0s3 type macvlan mode bridge

# Assign a free IP in the same subnet (different from 192.168.30.60 and 192.168.30.1)
sudo ip addr add 192.168.30.254/24 dev macvlan0

# Bring it up
sudo ip link set macvlan0 up
```

Context: You are running a Docker container inside an Ubuntu VM, and that container is attached to a macvlan network (plc-macvlan). By design, a macvlan network isolates container traffic - the host (your VM) cannot communicate with containers on that macvlan unless you explicitly add a macvlan on the host side too.  

So the 3 commands above make the VM itself a part of the same network as the container.

1. `sudo ip link add macvlan0 link enp0s3 type macvlan mode bridge`

- creates a new virtual network interface called `macvlan0`

- this interface is **attached** to your physical network interface `enp0s3` (the one the VM uses to access your LAN)

- the type **macvlan** creates a separate interface with its own MAC address 

- `mode bridge` means that traffic on `enp0s3` will be bridged with `macvlan0` - both can send/receive packets in the same Layer 2 domain.

Why is it needed:

- Docker's `macvlan` driver puts containers in the same L2 domain but isolates them from the host.

- By creating `macvlan0`, your **VM becomes reachable** to and from containers in that macvlan network.







To persist the macvlan interface created above:





1Ô∏è‚É£ Container is running and reachable from the VM
From your last command:
ping -I macvlan0 192.168.30.201
You get:
64 bytes from 192.168.30.201 ...
‚úÖ This means inside the VM, the container is reachable via the macvlan0 interface. The container is up and responding to pings from the VM itself.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Container is not reachable from the VM‚Äôs default interface
When you just run:
ping 192.168.30.201
You get:
Destination Host Unreachable
This happens because Docker macvlan creates an isolated network, and the host VM‚Äôs default interface (enp0s3) cannot talk to the macvlan interface directly. This is a known limitation of macvlan:
A host cannot communicate with a container on a macvlan network by default.
3Ô∏è‚É£ How to reach the container from the host machine (your physical machine or host VM)
Since your VM is attached as Bridged Adapter, the host machine is on the same subnet (192.168.30.0/24) as your container. To reach the container:
Option A: Add a macvlan sub-interface on the host machine
You need to create a macvlan interface on your host machine, attached to the same physical network as the VM.
Give it an IP in the same subnet (but not conflicting with gateway, VM, or container IPs).
Example on host:
sudo ip link add macvlan-host link <host_interface> type macvlan mode bridge
sudo ip addr add 192.168.30.250/24 dev macvlan-host
sudo ip link set macvlan-host up
Then ping:
ping 192.168.30.201
