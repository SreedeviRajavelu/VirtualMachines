The ubuntu vm is on a Remote Desktop, docker container is running on the ubuntu vm which is on the Remote Desktop, and I want to be able to access the docker container from my own host machine, not on the Remote Desktop, are there additional steps to be done if I want to access the plc browser of the docker container

🧩 Your Current Setup (summarized)

Let’s restate the network chain:
Your Laptop (Host)
   ↓
Remote Desktop Server (Hypervisor or another host)
   ↓
Ubuntu VM (IP: 192.168.30.60)
   ↓
Docker Container (OpenPLC, IP: 192.168.30.201 on macvlan)

You already did:
The macvlan network setup ✅
The container is running and reachable from inside the Ubuntu VM ✅ (ping -I macvlan0 192.168.30.201)

The OpenPLC web UI runs on port 8080 inside the container ✅ (default)

Now the problem:
You cannot reach http://192.168.30.201:8080 from your own laptop, only from within the Ubuntu VM.
🧠 Why This Happens

A macvlan network gives containers their own MAC addresses and connects them directly to the physical network — but only within the same Layer 2 domain (LAN).
If your laptop and the Ubuntu VM’s network (192.168.30.x) are not on the same LAN, or if the Remote Desktop host doesn’t bridge your VM’s NIC properly, your laptop won’t be able to reach that container’s IP directly.

So let’s go through possible solutions.

🛠️ Option 1: Access via Port Forwarding (simplest & most reliable)
You can forward the container’s port (8080) to the Ubuntu VM’s IP, which you already can reach through Remote Desktop.

🪜 Steps:
1️⃣ Stop and remove the container that’s using macvlan:
docker stop st_plc
docker rm st_plc

2️⃣ Run it again using bridge network (not macvlan), and expose port 8080:
docker run -d --name st_plc -p 8080:8080 --privileged openplc:v3

3️⃣ Check it’s running:
docker ps

4️⃣ From your laptop, open:
http://<Ubuntu_VM_IP>:8080

Example:
http://192.168.30.60:8080

✅ You’ll see the OpenPLC web interface.

💡 Why this works

The port mapping (-p 8080:8080) tells Docker:

“Forward traffic from the VM’s port 8080 → to the container’s port 8080.”

Your laptop can reach the Ubuntu VM’s IP.

So you can reach the container UI directly.

🧱 Option 2: Keep macvlan and bridge traffic from outside (advanced)

If you must keep macvlan (for PLC simulation realism or LAN integration), then your VM’s NIC must be in the same broadcast domain as your laptop.

That means:

The 192.168.30.x network of your container and VM must be accessible from your laptop’s network.

If your Remote Desktop VM is NATed, your laptop can’t reach it directly — you’ll need to set up a route or bridge on the hypervisor level.

For example, on the Remote Desktop host (if you control it):

sudo ip route add 192.168.30.0/24 via <Ubuntu_VM_IP>

And ensure the hypervisor’s virtual switch is in bridged mode (not NAT).

But this setup requires admin access to the Remote Desktop host — not always possible.

⚙️ Option 3: SSH Tunnel (secure workaround)

If you cannot change network bridging but can SSH into the Ubuntu VM, you can tunnel the OpenPLC port to your local machine.

🪜 Steps from your laptop:

`ssh -L 8080:192.168.30.201:8080 ubuntu@<Ubuntu_VM_IP>`

Then, on your laptop, visit:

http://localhost:8080

✅ SSH securely forwards port 8080 from your local laptop to the container inside the VM, even through NAT or Remote Desktop.

🧩 Summary Table
Goal	Method	Pros	Cons

✅ Access from your laptop easily	Port forwarding (-p 8080:8080)	Easiest, works anywhere	Container no longer uses macvlan

⚙️ Keep macvlan realism	Bridge networking on host	Same subnet realism	Needs admin control on Remote Desktop host

🔒 Secure remote access	SSH tunnel	No reconfiguration, encrypted	Needs SSH access every time

🚀 Recommended for You

Since your VM is inside a Remote Desktop environment, the simplest and most stable method is:
➤ Use Option 1 (Port Forwarding):

`docker run -d --name st_plc -p 8080:8080 --privileged openplc:v3`

Then access from your host browser:

`http://<Ubuntu_VM_IP>:8080`

That’ll reliably work regardless of NAT or RDP network complexity.

Would you like me to show how you can keep both macvlan and port forwarding simultaneously — so you can test PLC communications and still access the UI from your host machine?


## Question

I have multiple plc containers running on different ip addresses on the docker macvlan network 
If I use localhost to access it will not be possible to access different containers on the browser separately so I need to use the ip address to be unique and use that to access the plc runtime 

ssh -L 8080:192.168.30.201:8080 ubuntu@192.168.30.60

http://localhost:8080


## Answer

Excellent observation — you’re absolutely right ✅

If you have multiple OpenPLC containers, each running on a different IP (for example 192.168.30.201, 192.168.30.202, 192.168.30.203, etc.) in your Docker macvlan network, then mapping them all to localhost:8080 would overlap — only one tunnel could use that local port at a time.
Let’s go over how to handle this cleanly and flexibly.

🧠 Why localhost won’t scale

If you tunnel all of them like:

`ssh -L 8080:192.168.30.201:8080 ubuntu@192.168.30.60`

then you’d always have to reuse localhost:8080 — so only one can be accessed at once.

You need different **local ports** for each tunnel.
⚙️ The Correct Way (multiple tunnels, unique local ports)
Use different local ports per container:

# For first PLC

ssh -L 8081:192.168.30.201:8080 ubuntu@192.168.30.60

# For second PLC

ssh -L 8082:192.168.30.202:8080 ubuntu@192.168.30.60

# For third PLC

ssh -L 8083:192.168.30.203:8080 ubuntu@192.168.30.60

Then on your host browser, you can open:
PLC	Browser URL
PLC #1	http://localhost:8081
PLC #2	http://localhost:8082
PLC #3	http://localhost:8083
Each one will map to a different container, through the SSH tunnel.

🧠 What’s happening behind the scenes

SSH on your host forwards:

localhost:8081 → (SSH tunnel) → 192.168.30.201:8080
localhost:8082 → (SSH tunnel) → 192.168.30.202:8080
localhost:8083 → (SSH tunnel) → 192.168.30.203:8080

over the single SSH connection to your Ubuntu VM.

🚀 Optional: Single SSH session, multiple tunnels
Instead of opening multiple SSH windows, you can define multiple -L options in one command:
ssh \
-L 8081:192.168.30.201:8080 \
-L 8082:192.168.30.202:8080 \
-L 8083:192.168.30.203:8080 \
ubuntu@192.168.30.60

Then open all three PLC interfaces from your host browser:

http://localhost:8081
http://localhost:8082
http://localhost:8083

🧩 Summary
Goal	Command	Browser URL
Access PLC 1	ssh -L 8081:192.168.30.201:8080 ubuntu@192.168.30.60	http://localhost:8081
Access PLC 2	ssh -L 8082:192.168.30.202:8080 ubuntu@192.168.30.60	http://localhost:8082
Access PLC 3	ssh -L 8083:192.168.30.203:8080 ubuntu@192.168.30.60	http://localhost:8083
Would you like me to show you how to automate this SSH tunneling (e.g. using an .ssh/config file or startup script) so you don’t need to type all these each time?
