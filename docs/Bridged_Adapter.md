Excellent question ‚Äî and one that a lot of people get tripped up on when mixing **VirtualBox/VMware networking modes** with **Docker networking**.

Let‚Äôs go step by step to make it crystal clear **why we can conclude that `enp0s3` is the interface tied to the bridged adapter** in your Ubuntu VM setup.

---

### üß© Step 1. How VirtualBox (or other hypervisors) name interfaces

When you create a **VM in VirtualBox**, each ‚ÄúAdapter‚Äù (NAT, Bridged, Host-only, etc.) is exposed inside the guest OS (Ubuntu) as a **network interface** ‚Äî typically named:

```
enp0s3, enp0s8, enp0s9, etc.
```

The **first adapter** (Adapter 1) almost always appears as **`enp0s3`** inside the VM.
So if Adapter 1 in VirtualBox is configured as **Bridged Adapter**, `enp0s3` is the bridged interface.

---

### üß© Step 2. Confirming with your VM‚Äôs IP

You ran:

```bash
ip addr show enp0s3
```

and got:

```
inet 192.168.30.60/24 brd 192.168.30.255 scope global enp0s3
```

Your **Remote Desktop network** and **host network** are also on the `192.168.30.0/24` subnet.
‚û°Ô∏è That means `enp0s3` is **connected to the same LAN as your host and remote desktop** ‚Äî typical of a **Bridged Adapter** connection.

If it were a **NAT adapter**, you‚Äôd see a **different subnet**, like `10.0.2.x` (the default NAT range VirtualBox uses).

‚úÖ **Therefore:** The fact that `enp0s3` has `192.168.30.60` ‚Äî a LAN IP ‚Äî means it‚Äôs bridged to your physical network card.

---

### üß© Step 3. How you used it in Docker

You created the Docker macvlan using:

```bash
docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.40.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.40.1 \
  -o parent=enp0s3 \
  plc-macvlan-40
```

The `-o parent=enp0s3` tells Docker:

> ‚ÄúAttach this macvlan network to the same Layer 2 segment as `enp0s3`.‚Äù

Since `enp0s3` is your bridged adapter to the real network, each container‚Äôs IP (e.g., `192.168.40.201`) appears as a **separate device** on that LAN (from the VM‚Äôs perspective).

---

### üß© Step 4. How you verified it works

You were able to access PLC containers from outside (your host):

```
http://192.168.30.60:8081/dashboard
```

That‚Äôs only possible because:

* `enp0s3` connects your Ubuntu VM directly to the **same physical network** as your host and remote desktop (bridged).
* iptables DNAT forwards traffic from `192.168.30.60` (on enp0s3) ‚Üí PLC containers (on macvlan).

If `enp0s3` were a NAT adapter, your host could not reach `192.168.30.60:8081` directly.

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Interface         | Source                              | Meaning                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enp0s3`          | First network adapter in VirtualBox | This is the **Bridged Adapter** connected to your LAN               |
| `192.168.30.60`   | IP address assigned to `enp0s3`     | Same subnet as your Remote Desktop and host ‚Äî confirms it‚Äôs bridged |
| Docker parent     | `-o parent=enp0s3`                  | Macvlan attaches to this physical NIC                               |
| `192.168.40.0/24` | macvlan subnet                      | Separate subnet for Docker containers                               |
| iptables rules    | Map 8081‚Äì8084 to 192.168.40.201‚Äì204 | Enable access from LAN to macvlan network via enp0s3                |

### üß† TL;DR

You know `enp0s3` is the **bridged adapter** because:

1. It‚Äôs the first adapter (VirtualBox convention).
2. It has an IP in your LAN subnet (`192.168.30.x`).
3. Traffic from your host can reach it directly.
4. Your iptables DNAT setup works only because it‚Äôs bridged.

If you want, I can show you exactly how to **verify this conclusively** with a one-liner using:

```bash
ip route show default
```

Would you like me to include that check?
