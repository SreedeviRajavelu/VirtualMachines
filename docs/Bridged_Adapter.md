### How do you know that enp0s3 is the bridged adapter?

Excellent question ‚Äî and one that a lot of people get tripped up on when mixing **VirtualBox/VMware networking modes** with **Docker networking**.

Let‚Äôs go step by step to make it crystal clear **why we can conclude that `enp0s3` is the interface tied to the bridged adapter** in your Ubuntu VM setup.

---

### üß© Step 1. How VirtualBox (or other hypervisors) name interfaces

When you create a **VM in VirtualBox**, each ‚ÄúAdapter‚Äù (NAT, Bridged, Host-only, etc.) is exposed inside the guest OS (Ubuntu) as a **network interface** ‚Äî typically named:

```
enp0s3, enp0s8, enp0s9, etc.
```

The **first adapter** (Adapter 1) almost always appears as **`enp0s3`** inside the VM.
So if Adapter 1 in VirtualBox is configured as **Bridged Adapter**, `enp0s3` is the bridged interface.

---

### üß© Step 2. Confirming with your VM‚Äôs IP

You ran:

```bash
ip addr show enp0s3
```

and got:

```
inet 192.168.30.60/24 brd 192.168.30.255 scope global enp0s3
```

Your **Remote Desktop network** and **host network** are also on the `192.168.30.0/24` subnet.
‚û°Ô∏è That means `enp0s3` is **connected to the same LAN as your host and remote desktop** ‚Äî typical of a **Bridged Adapter** connection.

If it were a **NAT adapter**, you‚Äôd see a **different subnet**, like `10.0.2.x` (the default NAT range VirtualBox uses).

‚úÖ **Therefore:** The fact that `enp0s3` has `192.168.30.60` ‚Äî a LAN IP ‚Äî means it‚Äôs bridged to your physical network card.

---

### üß© Step 3. How you used it in Docker

You created the Docker macvlan using:

```bash
docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.40.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.40.1 \
  -o parent=enp0s3 \
  plc-macvlan-40
```

The `-o parent=enp0s3` tells Docker:

> ‚ÄúAttach this macvlan network to the same Layer 2 segment as `enp0s3`.‚Äù

Since `enp0s3` is your bridged adapter to the real network, each container‚Äôs IP (e.g., `192.168.40.201`) appears as a **separate device** on that LAN (from the VM‚Äôs perspective).

---

### üß© Step 4. How you verified it works

You were able to access PLC containers from outside (your host):

```
http://192.168.30.60:8081/dashboard
```

That‚Äôs only possible because:

* `enp0s3` connects your Ubuntu VM directly to the **same physical network** as your host and remote desktop (bridged).
* iptables DNAT forwards traffic from `192.168.30.60` (on enp0s3) ‚Üí PLC containers (on macvlan).

If `enp0s3` were a NAT adapter, your host could not reach `192.168.30.60:8081` directly.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Interface         | Source                              | Meaning                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enp0s3`          | First network adapter in VirtualBox | This is the **Bridged Adapter** connected to your LAN               |
| `192.168.30.60`   | IP address assigned to `enp0s3`     | Same subnet as your Remote Desktop and host ‚Äî confirms it‚Äôs bridged |
| Docker parent     | `-o parent=enp0s3`                  | Macvlan attaches to this physical NIC                               |
| `192.168.40.0/24` | macvlan subnet                      | Separate subnet for Docker containers                               |
| iptables rules    | Map 8081‚Äì8084 to 192.168.40.201‚Äì204 | Enable access from LAN to macvlan network via enp0s3                |

---

### üß† TL;DR

You know `enp0s3` is the **bridged adapter** because:

1. It‚Äôs the first adapter (VirtualBox convention).
2. It has an IP in your LAN subnet (`192.168.30.x`).
3. Traffic from your host can reach it directly.
4. Your iptables DNAT setup works only because it‚Äôs bridged.

---

If you want, I can show you exactly how to **verify this conclusively** with a one-liner using:

```bash
ip route show default
```

Would you like me to include that check?



### On my own host machine where I access the plc browsers using http://192.168.30.60:8081/dashboard , I do not see enp0s3 or any interface that matches the subnet of the VM on the Remote Desktop , explain further how my host machine is able to access the ubuntu vm's ip and the docker container running in the Ubuntu vm when there is no corresponding interface, or correct me if there is a corresponding interface to access the 192.168.30.60 (on enp0s3) ‚Üí PLC container

Excellent, detailed observation ‚Äî and this is one of those subtle but *really interesting* networking questions where you‚Äôre absolutely right to notice:

> ‚ÄúWait, I don‚Äôt see any 192.168.30.x interface on my host ‚Äî so how am I even reaching 192.168.30.60?‚Äù

Let‚Äôs unpack exactly **why you can access the Ubuntu VM (192.168.30.60)** and its PLC containers even though your host has *no visible interface* on that subnet.

---

## üß© The key is the **Remote Desktop (RDP)** network path

Here‚Äôs the hierarchy you described:

```
[Your MacBook or Host Machine]  ‚Üê (RDP connection) ‚Üí  [Remote Desktop: 192.168.30.5]
       ‚îÇ                                               ‚îÇ
       ‚îÇ                                               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (Ubuntu VM: 192.168.30.60)
       ‚îÇ                                                        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (Docker macvlan: 192.168.40.0/24)
       ‚îÇ                                                        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ iptables DNAT forwarding 8081‚Äì8084
```

### üß† What‚Äôs actually happening

You‚Äôre **not accessing 192.168.30.60 directly from your Mac‚Äôs local interface**.
Instead, your RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) session to `192.168.30.5` acts like a **portal** into that internal network (192.168.30.0/24).

Your Mac likely has:

* An **active VPN** or **corporate tunnel interface** (e.g., `utun4` showing `200.10.30.154`)
* That VPN provides routing to internal subnets like `192.168.30.0/24`.

So when you go to:

```
http://192.168.30.60:8081/dashboard
```

‚Üí the traffic goes **through your VPN or RDP tunnel**, into the **Remote Desktop network**, and reaches the Ubuntu VM.

---

## üß± Why you don‚Äôt see 192.168.30.x in `ifconfig`

Your Mac only lists its **local interfaces** ‚Äî those physically present or logically connected.

But your connection to `192.168.30.60` doesn‚Äôt require a local interface *on that subnet* because:

* There‚Äôs a **route** (via VPN, RDP tunnel, or NAT) that sends traffic to that subnet indirectly.
* macOS knows: ‚Äúif I need to reach 192.168.30.60, send packets via my VPN interface (utun4).‚Äù

You can confirm this routing path using:

```bash
netstat -rn | grep 192.168.30
```

or

```bash
route get 192.168.30.60
```

‚úÖ You‚Äôll likely see something like:

```
route to: 192.168.30.60
destination: 192.168.30.0
gateway: 200.10.30.153
interface: utun4
```

That shows your packets go via `utun4` ‚Äî your VPN/tunnel interface ‚Äî *not* a local interface like `en0`.

---

## üîÑ How the access chain actually works

Let‚Äôs trace your connection when you visit
`http://192.168.30.60:8081/dashboard`:

1. **Your browser on the host** ‚Üí sends TCP packets to 192.168.30.60:8081
2. **macOS routing** ‚Üí sees that 192.168.30.0/24 is reachable via `utun4` (VPN or remote tunnel)
3. **Traffic enters the remote LAN** (the same network where your Remote Desktop 192.168.30.5 lives)
4. **VM‚Äôs bridged adapter enp0s3 (192.168.30.60)** receives the traffic
5. **iptables DNAT** in the Ubuntu VM forwards:

   ```
   192.168.30.60:8081 ‚Üí 192.168.40.201:8080
   ```

   and so on for the other PLCs.
6. **Docker macvlan interface** passes it to the correct PLC container
7. **Response travels back** ‚Üí through the same path ‚Üí appears in your browser.

So even though your host doesn‚Äôt have a `192.168.30.x` interface, it can still reach it **via a routed or tunneled network**.

---

## üß≠ Analogy

Think of it like this:

> You can visit a friend in another city without living there ‚Äî because the highway (your VPN or RDP network) connects your location to theirs.

Your host‚Äôs local ‚Äúaddress‚Äù (10.x.x.x) doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äî the route takes care of the connection.

---

| iptables DNAT                        | Forwards ports 8081‚Äì8084 ‚Üí specific PLC IPs                            |
| Your host access works               | Due to routed connectivity through VPN or RDP‚Äôs internal network       |

---

Would you like me to **diagram this path** visually ‚Äî showing how the traffic travels from your Mac‚Äôs interface (utun4) ‚Üí Remote Desktop network (192.168.30.0/24) ‚Üí Ubuntu VM ‚Üí PLC container?
It would help make this chain very intuitive.
