### Question:

I have ssh-ed into an ubuntu vm at 192.168.30.60 using vpn tunnel I want to transfer a folder from my local host into the ubuntu vm, how can I do this?

Perfect — since you already **SSH-ed into the Ubuntu VM at `192.168.30.60` via a VPN tunnel**, there are several reliable ways to transfer a folder from your **local host (Mac)** to that **remote Ubuntu VM**.

---

### 🟢 **Option 1 — Use `scp` (Simple and Recommended)**

`scp` (secure copy) is the easiest way to transfer files or folders over SSH.

#### 📁 To copy a folder **from your local Mac → Ubuntu VM**

```bash
scp -r /path/to/local/folder ubuntu@192.168.30.60:/home/ubuntu/
```

Example:

```bash
scp -r ~/Documents/myproject ubuntu@192.168.30.60:/home/ubuntu/
```

* `-r` → recursive (for directories)
* `ubuntu` → username on the VM
* `/home/ubuntu/` → destination path inside the VM

It will prompt for your SSH password or use your SSH key automatically if already set up.

---

### 🟣 **Option 2 — Use `rsync` (faster and resumable)**

If the folder is large or you might re-transfer updates, use `rsync`:

```bash
rsync -avz ~/Documents/myproject ubuntu@192.168.30.60:/home/ubuntu/
```

* `-a` → archive mode (preserve permissions, etc.)
* `-v` → verbose
* `-z` → compress during transfer (good for VPNs)

If interrupted, you can rerun the same command — it resumes efficiently.

---

### 🟠 **Option 3 — If you’re already SSH’ed in (using terminal)**

If you are **inside** the SSH session and want to pull files **from your local** machine,
you need to open a **new terminal on your local Mac** and run the `scp` or `rsync` command **from your Mac**, not from within SSH.

(SSH connections are one-way for file transfer; the copy command must be run from the source side.)

---

### 🔵 **Option 4 — Using Visual Tools (Optional)**

If you prefer GUI methods:

* Use **VS Code Remote SSH** extension → open the Ubuntu VM and drag files.
* Or use **FileZilla**:

  * Protocol: SFTP
  * Host: `192.168.30.60`
  * Username: `ubuntu`
  * Password: *(your SSH password)*
  * Port: `22`

---

### 🧠 Tip

You can verify the transfer:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.30.60
ls -l /home/ubuntu/
```

You should see your folder there.

Would you like me to show you how to copy the folder **in reverse** (from the Ubuntu VM → your Mac) as well?
