## Docker Bridge
- 2 segments that the bridge connects is:
  - local host e.g. your laptop, or linux server where you run your Docker containers
  - virtual network created by Docker
  -       

### When you install Docker for the first time, it will create a default bridge network on the host (slightly different on MacOS as it will 
- all containers you create on that host will get an IP address on that range

On a Linux host, Docker Engine directly creates a docker0 bridge network interface in the hostâ€™s network stack. Thatâ€™s the familiar default bridge you see with ifconfig or ip a (usually 172.17.0.1/16).
On a Mac (macOS) or Windows, things are different:

Docker Desktop does not create a native docker0 bridge interface on your MacBookâ€™s network stack.

Instead, Docker Desktop runs all containers inside a lightweight Linux VM (on macOS, this is managed using Appleâ€™s HyperKit or now a Virtualization Framework).

Inside that VM, Docker does create a docker0 bridge (just like on Linux). But this bridge is inside the VM, not on macOS itself.

From your MacBookâ€™s perspective, you wonâ€™t see docker0 if you run ifconfig or ip a. Instead, Docker Desktop sets up a special networking layer that forwards traffic between your MacBook and the VM.

So to answer directly:

ðŸ‘‰ No, Docker Desktop does not create a default bridge network on your MacBookâ€™s host network stack.
ðŸ‘‰ Yes, it does create a default bridge network inside the Linux VM where your containers run.

If you run:
` docker network ls `
youâ€™ll still see bridge, host, and none listed, because those networks exist in the Docker VM environment, even though your Mac itself doesnâ€™t expose them as interfaces.

Do you want me to also explain how you can check the actual IP range of the bridge network inside Docker Desktop on your Mac?
